# Project-t-SNE-UMAP-MNIST-Dataset
This project is about t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) and UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) are both dimensionality reduction techniques commonly used in data analysis and visualization.

## Objectives:
1. Understand what are t-SNE and UMAP and be able to explain in the layman terms.
   
2. Demonstrate how to use t-SNE and UMAP in visualizing high-dimensional data.
